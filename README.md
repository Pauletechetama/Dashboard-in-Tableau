# About the project and Dataset
In this project i created a dashboard with 2 seperate visualizations from the World bank c02 dataset. The dataset contains 8 sheets that includes co2 data cleaned, co2(kt)pivoted, co2(kt)raw data and others but i used the visualizations from the co2 data cleaned. The sheet1 shows the visualization of the average co2 per capita of each country and the sheet2 shows the visualization of co2 production of each global region over time in a line chart. The link to the to the dataset is below. When you open the dataset below, you will immediately see the About page load with a single URL code at the top, please navigate to the bottom of the document and you can access all the raw and cleaned co2 data by clicking on different sheets.
