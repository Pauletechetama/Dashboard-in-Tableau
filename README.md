This repository shows how I created a dashboard in Tableau

# About the project and Dataset
In this project i created a dashboard with 2 seperate visualizations from the World bank c02 dataset. The dataset contains 8 sheets that includes co2 data cleaned, co2(kt)pivoted, co2(kt)raw data and others but i used the visualizations from the co2 data cleaned. The sheet1 shows the visualization of the average co2 per capita of each country and the sheet2 shows the visualization of co2 production of each global region over time in a line chart. The link to the dataset is below. When you open the dataset below, you will immediately see the About page load with a single URL code at the top, please navigate to the bottom of the document and you can access all the raw and cleaned co2 data by clicking on different sheets.

# Description
Logged into my Tableau profile, created a viz and uploaded the World bank co2 dataset. I loaded the co2 data cleaned in the field as that is what i will be working with and went ahead to create a visualization in sheet1 for the average co2 per capita of each country by loading the country name in the detail square and picking co2 per capita(metric tons) as the measure and converted it to AVERAGE and Customized the coloring of the measure.For sheet2, i made a line chart to see the co2 production by region. I picked the year column from Tables and co2(kt) as the measure (rows) and took Region to colors to be represented on the line chart, next i created a dashboard. I opened the dashboard sheet and added the visualizations in sheet1 and sheet2 earlier created by finding sheet1 in the sheet section and dragging it into the detailed square,i did same for sheet2 and it adjusted in the layout i wanted it,below sheet1. I proceeded to do a little cleaning by removing some legends to simplify the visualization, set the remaining legends to float and placed them onto the top right corner of the map and graph visualization.

# Summary
This project was solely about creating dashboards. The dashboard-style format presents data in an accessible and interactive way which enables easy communication of ones works and display dynamic data in professional setting. Dashboards put all the pertinent information in the same place,making it easier to understand the important takeaways. From the link below you can view the data visualization.
